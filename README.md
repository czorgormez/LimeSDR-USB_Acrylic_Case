# LimeSDR-USB Acrylic Case

![LUAC-01 case](/images/case.jpg)

An acrylic enclosure designed to accommodate the Myriad-RF LimeSDR-USB.

A complete kit of parts can be bought from [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr).

## Repository contents

The case design is provided in the following formats:

* Inkscape SVG (source)
* PDF
* DXF

The case parts are laser cut from the following types of acrylic sheet:

* Layer 01: 3mm midnight black (frosted opaque)
* Layer 02: 3mm black (opaque)
* Layer 03: 5mm glass look (clear with green hue)
* Layer 04: 5mm black (opaque)
* Layer 05: 3mm glass look (clear with green hue)

Other colours and finishes could be used, and the above were selected for a combination of aesthetic and practical reasons, e.g. frosted finish doesn't pick up finger marks.

## Bill of materials

In addition to the acrylic parts the kit contains:

## Other hardware required

- [LimeSDR-USB](https://myriadrf.org/projects/limesdr/)
- 4x panel mount SMA socket to U.FL coaxial cables

## Assembly

Please note that a [video assembly guide is also available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QyM0tKj0Co).

![Parts laid out](/images/01-layOut.jpg)

- Lay out all of the parts and ensure you have everything.

![Peel off acrylic backing](/images/02-peel.jpg)

- Remove the protective backing from the acrylic parts. Note that this is likely to generate static electricity so do not do this near sensitive electronics. Clean any clouding / marks from the acrylic that may have occured during manufacture.

![Identify layers](/images/03-dots.jpg)

- Each layer can be identified by small dots etched into the acrylic pieces and these should always face upwards during assembly. The fourth layer is pictured above.

![Fit nylon hardware](/images/04-fitNylon.jpg)

- Place the nylon screws down through the LimeSDR board mounting holes and secure with a nylon nut underneath, which will act as a spacer.

![Secure board to layer 1](/images/05-secureLayer1.jpg)

- Secure the board to Layer 1 using the remaing 4x nylon nuts, ensuring that the dot marking the layer is facing upwards when the board is, and the larger gap is at USB socket end. Trim the nylon screws to length with a pair of sharp side cutters.

![Add layer 2](/images/06-layer2.jpg)

- Insert the 6 steel screws up through layer 1 (screw heads on the underside) and then add layer 2, ensuring that this does not trap the foam pads on layer 1.

![Connect cables](/images/07-cables.jpg)

- Connect the U.FL to SMA cables, taking care to ensure that the U.FL connectors are correctly aligned and too much force is not applied. Also take great care when routing the cables to avoid damage to sensitive components.

![Add layer 3](/images/08-layer3.jpg)

- Add acrylic parts for layer 3, taking care not to trap cables.

![Add layer 4](/images/09-layer4.jpg)

- Add layer 4.

![Add steel nuts](/images/10-steelNuts.jpg)

- Add layer 5 and secure with the 6 steel nuts, but only finger tight.

![Reverse steel screws](/images/11-reverseScrews.jpg)

- One at a time, remove the steel screws and reverse these so that they go in from the top side, and gently tighten.

![Add SMA washers and nuts](/images/12-secureSMA.jpg)

- Add the SMA washers and nuts, and gently tighten. Take care not to apply too much force or the acrylic may crack.

![Add rubber bumpers](/images/13-addBumpers.jpg)

- Add the rubber bumpers to the underside.
